# Project Objective üéØ
The objective of this project is to offer a comprehensive understanding of customer complaints across various financial services, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights into complaint patterns, service efficiency, and resolution effectiveness. By analyzing key metrics such as Total Complaints, Rolling 12 Months, Closed %, and In Progress %, the project identifies areas with the highest customer dissatisfaction and uncovers improvement opportunities. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making, enhance service quality, and improve customer satisfaction through detailed visualizations and interactive dashboard.

# Data Overview üìë
The dataset originates from an organization in the financial services sector, focusing on customer complaints. It comprises two key tables: Customer Complaints Data and State Map Data. The Customer Complaints Data captures crucial details such as Complaint ID, Company Public Response, Company Response to Consumer, Date Received, Date Submitted, Issue, Service, State, Sub-issue, Service Sub-category, Submitted via, Timely Response, ZIP Code, Number of Complaints, and Target. These attributes provide a granular view of complaints across various service categories like Bank Services, Credit Cards, and Mortgages. The State Map Data includes geographical information such as State, Number of Records, and other location-based attributes, enabling spatial analysis of complaint trends. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables, requiring thorough preprocessing and cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability. This well-structured data foundation facilitates the identification of complaint patterns, resolution efficiency, and service performance across regions and financial services.
